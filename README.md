📡 Telecom Transmission Planning & Aggregation Design Challenge
Overview

This project documents the solution to a telecommunications transmission planning challenge involving bandwidth calculation, Busy Hour Traffic (BHT) engineering, microwave backhaul dimensioning, redundancy planning, and future capacity growth.

The objective was to design a resilient aggregation network for multiple BTS sites distributed across an urban, suburban, and inter-city corridor, while respecting utilization, latency, and availability constraints.

This project demonstrates:

Practical telecom traffic engineering

Microwave transmission planning using Packet Link Aggregation (PLA)

Redundancy and protection design

Capacity planning with future growth considerations

Clear documentation and topology visualization

## 📋 Challenge Statement

Each student was assigned a logical cluster of **65 live BTS sites** distributed across a dense urban core, suburban districts, and an inter-city highway corridor. The BTS sites were grouped under **five aggregation hubs (Hub A, Hub B, Hub C, Hub D, and Hub E)**.

These hubs represent real aggregation locations where BTS traffic is backhauled using a **hybrid transmission network of fiber and licensed microwave links**. **Hub A** is the only hub directly connected to the **BSC** at the regional switching center and also provides onward connectivity to the IP core for packet services.

For each BTS, carried traffic is split across:
- **2G** (voice)
- **3G** (packet data)
- **4G** (high-speed data and real-time services)

Students were required to:
- Calculate the total bandwidth per BTS
- Engineer the network based on **Busy Hour Traffic (BHT)**
- Ensure no link exceeds **70% utilization**
- Dimension uplinks from Hub B, C, D, and E toward Hub A
- Determine total bandwidth required on the **Hub A – BSC** link

### Additional Design Constraints

- **Redundancy Requirement:**  
  The network must meet a **99.95% availability target**. If any single uplink from Hub B, C, D, or E to Hub A fails, traffic must be rerouted through other hubs using protection links with **30% additional headroom** and no oversubscription.

- **Latency Constraint:**  
  4G traffic must not traverse more than **two hub hops** to reach Hub A under both normal and failure conditions. Each hub-to-hub hop introduces **2 ms latency**.

- **Future Planning Rule:**  
  All links must be dimensioned to support a **25% traffic growth** projected over the next 18 months, without requiring upgrades.


📘 Challenge Description

Each student was assigned 65 live BTS sites, grouped under five aggregation hubs:

Hub A

Hub B

Hub C

Hub D

Hub E

Key constraints:

Each BTS carries 2G (voice), 3G (packet data), and 4G (high-speed & real-time services)

Traffic values represent Average Hour Traffic

Network must be engineered for Busy Hour Traffic (BHT)

No transmission link should exceed 70% utilization

Hub A is the only hub directly connected to the BSC and IP core

Aggregation is performed using fiber and licensed microwave links

🧮 Methodology
1️⃣ Total Bandwidth per BTS

For each BTS, total bandwidth was calculated by summing:

2G Traffic + 3G Traffic + 4G Traffic

2️⃣ Total Busy Hour Traffic per Hub

For each hub:

The total bandwidth of all 13 BTSs under that hub was summed

This represents the Busy Hour Traffic (BHT) for the hub

3️⃣ Future Traffic Growth

A 25% projected traffic growth over 18 months was applied:

Projected Traffic = Current BHT × 1.25

📊 Busy Hour Traffic Results
Hub	Current BHT (Mbps)	Projected BHT (+25%)
Hub A	637 Mbps	796 Mbps
Hub B	640 Mbps	800 Mbps
Hub C	880 Mbps	1100 Mbps
Hub D	869 Mbps	1086 Mbps
Hub E	738 Mbps	922 Mbps
🔗 Packet Link Aggregation (PLA)

Packet Link Aggregation (PLA) is a microwave transmission technique used to bundle multiple physical radio channels into a single logical link.

In this project:

Each PLA represents a 512+ Mbps licensed microwave channel

Multiple PLAs are aggregated to meet traffic demand

Utilization is engineered to remain ≤ 70% during Busy Hour

PLA allows scalable capacity without deploying new radios

Note: PLA in this project refers to Packet Link Aggregation, not Peak Load Allowance.

🛜 Uplink Capacity Engineering

For each hub (B–E), uplinks toward Hub A were dimensioned using:

Busy Hour Traffic

70% utilization constraint

Future traffic growth

PLA-based aggregation

Example:

2 × 512 Mbps PLA = 1024 Mbps logical uplink


Utilization calculations ensured all links remained within safe operational thresholds.

## 📊 Link Utilization Calculation

Transmission links were engineered to ensure that utilization does not exceed **70% during Busy Hour**, in line with standard telecom planning practices.

Link utilization was calculated using the formula:

Utilization (%) = (Traffic Load / Total Uplink Capacity) × 100

### Example Calculation

If a hub has a Busy Hour traffic load of **800 Mbps** and is provisioned with **2 × 512 Mbps PLA links**:

Total Uplink Capacity = 1024 Mbps

Utilization = (800 / 1024) × 100 ≈ **78%**

In this case, additional PLA capacity would be required to bring utilization within acceptable limits.

All final uplink designs in this project were dimensioned to operate at **≤ 70% utilization** under Busy Hour conditions.


🔁 Redundancy & Protection Design

To meet a 99.95% availability target, the network was designed with inter-hub protection paths:

If any single uplink to Hub A fails, traffic can reroute through other hubs

Protection links include 30% additional headroom

Oversubscription is not permitted

Dotted links in the topology represent redundancy paths

⏱️ Latency Constraint Validation

4G traffic is latency-sensitive

Maximum allowed hops to Hub A: 2 hops

Each hub-to-hub hop introduces 2 ms latency

✔ All normal and failure paths were validated to remain within latency limits.

🧱 Hub A – BSC Link Dimensioning

Hub A aggregates traffic from:

Hub A local BTSs

Hub B, C, D, and E

Total aggregated Busy Hour traffic (including growth) was used to dimension the Hub A → BSC uplink, ensuring:

≤ 70% utilization

Sufficient PLA capacity

Support for redundancy scenarios
